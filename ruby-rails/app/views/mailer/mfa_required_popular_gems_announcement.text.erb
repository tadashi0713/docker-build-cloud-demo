👋 Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Effective today, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required on your RubyGems account.

<% if @user.mfa_disabled? %> 
A number of operations are now restricted until you enable MFA.

These restrictions include editing profile pages on the web, signing in on the command line, and performing privileged actions (ie. push, yank, add/remove owners) (https://guides.rubygems.org/mfa-requirement-opt-in/#privileged-operations).

To re-enable these operations for your account, please enable multi-factor authentication 🙏.
<% elsif @user.mfa_ui_only? %>
Your current MFA level is no longer recommended. In fact, it's deprecated.
You need to upgrade your RubyGems account to a stronger MFA level 🙏.

We recommend setting the MFA level to "UI and API". However, "UI and gem signin" is acceptable too (https://guides.rubygems.org/setting-up-multifactor-authentication/#authentication-levels).

A number of operations are restricted until you upgrade your MFA setting.

These restrictions include editing profile pages on the web, signing in on the command line, and performing privileged actions (ie. push, yank, add/remove owners) (https://guides.rubygems.org/mfa-requirement-opt-in/#privileged-operations).
<% end %>

❤️ Thank you for making the RubyGems ecosystem more secure
