👋 Hi <%= @user.handle %>,

Recently, we've announced our security-focused ambitions to the community (https://blog.rubygems.org/2022/06/13/making-packages-more-secure.html).

Next week, on August 15, 2022, we will begin requiring maintainers like yourself, who are owners of packages with more than 180 million downloads, to have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled.

If you don't have MFA enabled by this date, a number of operations will be restricted.
These restrictions include editing profile pages on the web, signing in on the command line, and performing privileged actions (ie. push, yank, add/remove owners) (https://guides.rubygems.org/mfa-requirement-opt-in/#privileged-operations).

<% if @user.mfa_disabled? %> 
To avoid any disruptions with your RubyGems account, please enable multi-factor authentication 🙏.
<% elsif @user.mfa_ui_only? %>
We're notifying you of this policy because you have MFA enabled only for the UI.
Please upgrade your RubyGems account to a stronger MFA level 🙏.

We recommend setting the MFA level to "UI and API". However, "UI and gem signin" is acceptable too (https://guides.rubygems.org/setting-up-multifactor-authentication/#authentication-levels).
<% end %>

❤️ Thank you for making the RubyGems ecosystem more secure
